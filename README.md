My Meal suggestion application Report 

 

________________________________________________________________ 

 

I have designed an app to help my friend, Hera, and a lot of others who have a hard time deciding on what meal they have on busy days. This application would suggest meals to the user based on the time of the day. 

 

This is what the application looks like, it has a suggest button and a reset button as well as an edit text view for the user to enter a time of day. 

 

How does the application work 

When the user enters the time of day (morning, mid-morning, afternoon, mid-afternoon, evening), and clicks on the button, “suggest meal” a meal suggestion will pop up immediately depending on the time of day they have entered.  

 

There is also a reset button to reset the time of day and meal suggestion to be blank, for the user to continue and enter a different time of day receiving a different meal suggestion.

Here below, is my code for the application:

Design conderations 

 

I have designed my apllication to look very chic but simple. I have added 2 images, one of which looks like someone decided what to eat and the other showing differnet meals. These pictures suit my application very well. 

 

I have placed one image at the top and the other other at the bottom. In the middle i have but the text view with the suggest meal button and reset button below centred. I placed them like this to make it easy for the user to understand while enjoying the aesthetic of the application and how it works.

GitHub and GitHub Actions 

 

GitHub is an open-source version control software that allows multiple people to make sperate changes to different web pages all at once, reducing the risk of duplicative/conflicting work, also decreasing the production time. (June 2020) 

 

Github Actions is a continuous integration one to automate their build, test and deployment pipeline. Workflows can be created which would build and test every pull request to one’s repository or deploy merged pull requests to production. 

 

Yml. Files and their use 

 

Yml files are written in YMAL format which is a standard for serialising data that can be read by humans and works with all computer languages and is used to write configuration files. 

Yml. Files are used for configuration of files, automation and continuous integration. (Ady_Code, January 2024)
